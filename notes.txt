~~~1. Add AP/AD for each champ and for team average

~~~2. Fix mulitple match bug in stats by tracking matches that have been sampled. Possibly make matches array at root level and fill it with match IDs.

~~~3. Add ajax call to get stats. Request specific champions and generate the json to return to minimize data use.

~~~4. Fetch champion mastery and last played date for every player's champion. Make this run before data processing.

~~~5. Fetch each player's winrate

~~~6. Calculate each player's losing streak.


Slogan
--------------
"Stats are good, winning is better."


To Do Later
---------------
+Tweak aggressiveness calculation constant in sigmoid function. Also, it seems to give high results in low elo and low results in high elo. Aggresssiveness may scale oddly with number of games loaded by trending toward 50% with a longer game history. More experimentation required.
